# PowerBI-BrainScan

📖 Overview  

The MRI Brain Scan Dashboard is a Power BI project that analyzes and visualizes patient MRI data. It delivers insights into demographics, scan outcomes, diagnoses, and hospital performance, supporting healthcare professionals, researchers, and analysts in making data-driven decisions related to brain health.

🚀 Key Features

👨‍⚕️ Patient Demographics – Breakdown by age, gender, and region

🧠 MRI Scan Insights – Scan counts, outcomes, and findings

📊 Diagnosis Trends – Common neurological conditions identified from scans

🏥 Hospital Performance – Patient volume & diagnostic patterns

🔎 Interactive Filters – Drill down by hospital, region, or time frame

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Visualization & dashboard design

Power Query – Data transformation (ETL)

Dataset – MRI brain scan records (patients, hospitals, outcomes)

KPIs – Total scans, diagnostic results, patient count, hospital metrics
